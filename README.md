## Fork & Clone this repository

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerGitPractice
* This can also be done directly in RStudio
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In RStudio - File - New Project... - Version Control - Git 
  * Paste the URL in the Repository URL: field.
  * Click Browse... and navigate to your folder.
  * Click Create Project.
  * Be patient. RStudio will clone the repository and create a new project.
  * When it is complete you should see the files from the repository in the Files pane at the bottom right of the window.
* This can also be done directly in VSCode
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In VSCode from the command pallette (Ctrl-Shift-P) run Git: Clone
  * Paste the path into the path field which pops up
  * Select your new folder you created on your machine
  * A new folder for the repository with the repository files should be in the folder you selected showing in the Explorer window in VSCode on the left side.

## Follow along with this tutorial

### RStudio part

* In RStudio open the R markdown file (.Rmd) by clicking on it in the Files pane.
* Complete the steps outlined in the assignment. (See the assignment answer sheet file included in this repository.)
* Create a markdown (.md) document by clicking the Knit button. Make sure the markdown file gets saved in the same folder as the R markdown file so it will get pushed back to your GitHub repository.

### Jamovi part

* Open Jamovi
* Try opening each of the file types (.csv, .sav, .xlsx) in Jamovi.
* The file menu looks like 3 horizontal lines at the top left of the Jamovi window.
* File - Open - Browse
* Navigate to your assignment folder where the files for this assignment are, select the file, and click Open.
* Save one of the files you opened as a Jamovi file (.omv).
* File - Save As - Browse
* Navigate to your assignment folder where the files for this assignment are and click Save.
* You should now have a .omv file in your assignment folder.
* Complete the assignment using the cars dataset in Jamovi. (See the assignment answer sheet fle included with this repository.)
  
  
## Push your updated files to your GitHub repository

* This can be done in RStudio.
  * Here's a nice video a student found demonstrating this process. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL6L2MNqPHg&feature=youtu.be 
  * Be patient as you complete these steps. RStudio can be a bit slow to respond.
  * Click on the Git tab in the top right section of the window.
  * You should see the files in your repository in the window.
  * Click in the checkbox in the Staged column to stage the changes you made.
  * Click on the Commit button. (Just above the Staged, Status, Path labels at the top of the pane.)
  * A new window will open which is titled RStudio: Review Changes.
  * Enter a commit message in the field on the right side of the window and click Commit.
  * Another popup should come up while the commit it made. You can close it when it's done.
  * Click the Push button on the top right of the window.
  * Another popup should come up while the push is done. You can close it when it's done.
  * If you check your GitHub repository, your new files or changes should be there.
* This can be done in VSCode.
  * In VSCode click on the Source Control button.
  * You should see the files that had changes. (Mine has the original file which shows an M next to it and a new file which says checkpoint in the name. You really only need to push the original file, but if you push both it shouldn't hurt anything.)
  * Hover over the changed file. Click the + sign to stage the change.
  * Enter a commit message in the message field and click the checkmark to commit the change.
  * Click on the 3 dots for more actions and select Sync. This will push the updated file to your GitHub repository.
* You can also directly add files to your GitHub repository online.
  * Navigate to your GitHub repository in a browser.
  * Click on the Add File button and select Upload Files. (It's right next to the Code button where you copy the URL for the repository when you clone it.)
  * Drag the files to the window or browse for them.
  * Remember to scroll to the bottom of the window and commit your changes or your file(s) won't be saved.
* Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas.

## About the Answer Sheets

* The answer sheets are for your convenience. I don't need them submitted to your repository. I've played around with the format a bit. The older version uses a side-by-side format. The newer format uses a full page width. Use whichever you prefer. They both say about the same thing. The answer sheets are written in Rich Text Format .rtf. It is a text file format which allows for some formatting. I've had some Mac users say it displays better if you convert it to a Word doc. Here is a video of someone describing some of the differences between a plain text file .txt and an .rtf file. (optional) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNu9B1ExezI
